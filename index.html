            Pizza is considered the most popular food in the world as a
            consequence of the Italian exodus that settled in America throughout
            the 20th century.

            Pizza in its most traditional versions, marinara and covered in
            tomato sauce and mozzarella (Neapolitan), comes from the Italian
            city of Naples.

          it is made in Saint-Denis; it is round in shape and is kneaded with
          the same dough as bread. It comes in different widths, depending on
          the price. A two liards pizza is enough for a man; a two sous pizza
          should fill the whole family. At first glance, pizza seems like a
          simple dish; upon examination, it is a mixed plate. The pizza is with
          oil, the pizza with bacon, the pizza with pork fat, the pizza with
